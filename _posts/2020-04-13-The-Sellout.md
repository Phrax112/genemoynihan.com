I don't much go for modern books. Apart from a few highly recommended types I've more often than not found myself lost between covers published in the 21st century, so much so as to eventually cast it aside to join the dusty, maybe someday pile.

The Sellout by Paul Beatty however is a book which grabs your attention and doesn't let it go until you've passed several hours laughing and feeling unease about how you look at race relations. A novel set in modern day LA which tells the story of a farmer who unwittingly becomes a slave owner and eventually an intention segregationist. This premise may sound strange already but as he does so often throughout the book Mr. Beatty manages to make it even more deliciously ironic through the fact that the protagonist is himself black.

I can only say that this book is the type that makes me immediately go out and buy everything else written by the author as well as add it to the list of books I will be recommending to friends for a very long time.
