Short and maybe not so sweet, Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" can be interpreted in lots of ways... most of which are beyond the effort being put into this blog post.

What I will say is that this book is really more of an essay (think 1 hour of reading time at a reasonable pace), excellently written and full of Hemingway's characteristic depictions of nature. For those that haven't read much of him this means that nature will always be at the forefront of every setting and central to every plot. Vivid depictions of the beauty of the natural world and its indifference for individual life is one of Hemingway's greatest assets and is essentially the entire premise of this short book.

Worth a read.
