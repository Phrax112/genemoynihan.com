I recently came across <a href="https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html">An Overview of Cryptography</a> written by Gary Kessler on his site. 
Maybe more accurately titled as a "Modern History of Crytopgraphy", it covers most of the major crytographic methods used in computing over the last half century and provides some interesting technical advice on when and where they should and (more importantly) should not be used.

I would highly recommend a read through for any developer who has not familiarised themselves with this subject before.
