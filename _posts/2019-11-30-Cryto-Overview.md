I recently came across <a href="https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html">An Overview of Cryptography</a> written by Gary Kessler on his site.
Maybe more accurately titled as a "Modern History of Crytopgraphy", it covers most of the major crytographic methods used in computing over the last half century and provides some interesting technical advice on when and where they should and (more importantly) should not be used. As a standard naive developer I found it pretty enlightening and would recommed it for anyone who hasn't done a deep dive into cryptogaphy before or is just interested in the history.
