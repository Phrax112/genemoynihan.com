*Background*  
Lost in Translation is a 2003 film, directed by Sofia Coppola, set predominantly within a hotel in modern Tokyo starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.


There is something magnificently relatable about Bill Murray in everything he does. His subtly defiant lack of traditional Hollywood leading man looks with their easy, oily charm leads him to become something much more; an archetypal everyman of sorts. Someone who we believe can have flaws and so therefore can overcome them and maybe teach us something along the way. He utilises comedy in an offhand way, truly comfortable in it's use as it oozes with his every action and word. This naturalness reveals his mastery of the comedic art, bringing it to even his more serious roles in a way that few actors I have seen can equal (perhaps Robin Williams would be the next example to mind).

In this movie, Murray plays a man who has "made it". A movie star receiving two million dollars to fly to Japan for just a few days to shoot a whiskey commercial before returning to his, as seen from afar, perfect life. However, to no ones surprise, there is trouble in paradise. The twist on the usual mid life crisis suffering millionaire act is that (as Johansson jokingly points out in the movie) it isn't manifesting in spending sprees or anger, but in loneliness and ennui.

Enter front and center, the pink underwear clad Scarlet Johansson. A recent college graduate of philosophy from Yale, married to a successful photographer and spending a week in Tokyo it is similarly difficult to tell where her problems could possibly lie. Unfortunately, as is often the case this is, in itself, the issue. Lost amidst self-help tapes and fruitless attempts to find distraction, in a foreign country seemingly hostile to strangers, we find our two protagonists in the only place left in the world that makes sense: the hotel bar.

What makes this movie special to me is twofold. Firstly, the relationship between the two main characters. Initially, Johansson represents a raw nerve, young and in some ways vulnerable juxtaposed sharply against the calloused, world weary exterior of Murray. However, as the film progresses these roles change dramatically. Johansson grows into the main star, leading Murray on a journey of discovery and helping lift him (and through him her) back to the hope of an enjoyable life. This is wonderfully represented by the cinematography of Coppola, using the actors clothes and colours to highlight changes in their relationship.

Secondly, the location. I think an important note to make whenever discussing this film is the setting. Japan is a place I recommend to everyone as a destination: to live, work or simply visit. In fact to most people I know I probably talk about it too much. To me it represents a lot of what we are losing in the modern era of globalisation, true cultural diversity. To step into Japan is to take a step into a world where all of your basis vectors have been shifted. The way people walk, talk, interact, eat, even go to the bathroom is different and from what I can tell from talking to Japanese people their way of approaching life is different at a fundamental level. I mention all of this as this movie didn't really impact me as much until I had actually visited Japan, by myself, for a significant period of time (in this case 3 weeks). To be lost is one thing, to be lost without any hope of an external saviour is another (speaking metaphorically of course, once the language barrier is overcome Japanese people are amazingly helpful). Often when you are bored you reach out for comfort from friends, tv, books, teddy bears whatever it may be. In Japan all of that is stripped away and you are laid naked with only your conscience for company. This idea is so beautifully explored within this movie it almost makes me uncomfortable watching it.

This movie is to me, perfect. The acting from the two lead characters as well as the directing is impeccable. The cinematography of Tokyo is limited in its use but that just serves to draw you in more as it highlights the differences with the quiet hotel scenes. This movie is not ambitious in its scope but is somehow all the braver for it. Seeking to describe a new relationship occurring over just a few days in limited settings, relying on only two actors with subtle yet profound characters arcs but yet to do so perfectly.

10/10
