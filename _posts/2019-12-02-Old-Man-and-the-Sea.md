I read "The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway in one sitting in a small cafe in Nago, Okinawa about 100 metres from the seafront. Seeing one of the worlds largest aquariums
and coming face to face with some incredible creatures of the deep probably influenced me to finally read this one which has been on my todo list
for many years. It is a very short book, which contributes to the easy recommendation due to the lack of time commitment required. The writing is great
and there are a myriad of various levels of comprehension (allegedly) for you to get your teeth into. I do however have mixed feelings about this book.
It's one of those books which leaves you with more questions than answers... Which I guess could well be a good thing, lacking a certain sense of closure but often making you question it, mulling over its meaning in your mind.

Hemingway's famous work of the old fisherman and his quest for the great marlin smacks of the allegorical in a lot of ways.
It could be interpreted as being about any number of traditional topics: the virtues of hard work and dedication, luck and fortune, fulfillment of life through suffering, of love for the natural world in it's beauty and the absolute rule of justice within it etc...
One thing that definitely does shine through is the latter in Hemingway's use of language in describing the events throughout the book,
which is probably worth the admission price in itself.

We see the world through the old fisherman's eye on many occasions, using his knowledge and experience to see things in the ocean and life that we would
never see ourselves. Seeing the wonder in the small details of long days of toil, of taking from the sea and giving back in equal measure. It is short, concise and easy to read but that does not mean that the events are not rich and full of detail. By the end of this short book you will have begun to sympathise with this
old man, hoping that for his actions he will eventually be rewarded, waiting for Hemingway to give you the easy out. Which he doesn't...but that just makes it
more analagous to life really.
