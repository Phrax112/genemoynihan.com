Short and maybe not so sweet, Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" can be interpreted in lots of ways... most of which are beyond the effort being put into this blog post.

What I can tell say is that this book is really more of an essay (think 1 hour of reading time at a reasonable pace), excellently written and full of Hemingway's characteristic depictions of nature. For those that haven't read much of him this means that nature will always be at the forefront of every setting and central to any ongoings. Vivid visual depictions of the beauty of the natural world as well as it's absolute sense of justice and total disregard for mortal life is one of Hemingway's greatest assets and is essentially the entire premise of this short book.

This is one of those books that has been on my todo list for a long time and I finally got to it at a seaside cafe in Nago, Okinawa on a perfect Autumn day this year. A perfect setting for this kind of book and I did very much enjoy reading it. However, I feel it will be a long time before I pick up this book again. It is a difficult kind of feeling to isolate but if I had to guess I would say I was disappointed. I didn't learn anything or gain insights from this book, the hidden layers of which much has been written about before didn't expose themselves to me beyond the obvious metaphors. Perhaps this book is one which has to come to you.
