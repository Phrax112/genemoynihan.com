I can't quite make up my mind if George Gilder is full of shit or not.
According to a brief scan of the internet he seems to be a mixture of an investor, economist, self-acclaimed prophet, political activist and tech evangelist.
He has written or co-written 18 books on these subjects and maybe most interestingly was a cofounder of the Design Institute... That's a whole other can of worms for a different blog post.

One thing I do know however, is that he is a man with interesting and different opinions.
This in itself is probably a good reason to go and pick up his latest work *Life After Google: The Fall of Big Data and the Rise of the Blockchain Economy*.
In this book Mr. Gilder issues a rallying cry for all technologists to throw down their Big Data(sets) and come join the Blockchain revolution.
The future as Mr. Gilder puts it is not in the price absent methods of Silicon Valley, with their data centres creaking under the weight of sorting the
internets wheat and chaff. It is instead coming our way (and soon) in a great "unbundling". A decoupling of major tech companies and their data,
a decentralisation process which at it's heart will have the Blockchain.

Whether or not any of the above is true, I don't know, I will instead redirect you to the first line of this blog post.
However, in my opinion even if Mr. Gilder's vision of the future does not unfold, the current dynamic does seem to be at a inflection point.
As national and international agencies such as China and the EU bear down on data laws, increasing scrutiny over cross-border data transfer,
murmurings over the breakups of big tech monopolies in the wind it is difficult to envisage nothing changing in the long term.

Cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems have their own faults, that is plain to see but are they the future? Maybe George Gilder knows.
