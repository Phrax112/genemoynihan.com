>The conversation switched over to the new topic - the educations of women.
Karenin expressed the view that the education of women was usually confused with the question of women's emancipation and that this was the only reason for
considering it pernicious.

>"To my mind, on the contrary, these two questions are indispensably linked to each other," said Pestsov. "It's a vicious circle. Women are deprived of
rights because of inadequate education while the inadequacy of their education is inadequate due to their lack of rights. It must not be forgotten that
the subjection of women is so complete and goes back so far that we often refuse to recognize the abyss that separates them from us," he said.

>"You said 'rights'," said Koznyshov, who had been waiting for Pestsov to stop. "The rights of jury duty, of voting on Town Councils, of presiding at local
government boards, of entering the civil service, sitting in parliament?..."

>"Unquestionably."

>"But even if women, by way of rare exception can occupy these positions then it sees to me you were wrong in using the expression 'rights'. It would have been
more correct to say 'duties'. Anyone will agree that by performing whatever the functions are of a juryman, a Town Councilor, or telegraph clerk we feel that
we're performing a duty. That's why it would be more correct to say that what women are seeking is duties, and quite rightly too. One can only sympathise with
this desire of theirs to assist men in their social labours."

>"Absolutely right," agreed Karenin. "I think the only question is whether they are suited to such duties."

>"Probably they would be very suitable," Oblonklsy put in, "as soon as education has spread among them. We can see this-"

>"And what about the proverb?" said the old Prince, who had been listening to the conversation for some time, his ironic little eyes twinkling: "my daughters
won't mind- 'long hair, short wits...'"

>"Just the same thing was thought about the Negroes before their emancipation!" said Pestsov angrily.

>"The only thing I find odd is that women should be seeking new duties," said Koznyshov, "when we see men, unfortunately, as a rule avoiding them."

>"Duties are bound up with rights: power, money, honors- that's what women are seeking," said Pestov.

>"It's just the same as though I were to seek the right to be a wet nurse and felt offended at women's being paid for it while no one wanted me," said the old
Prince.
