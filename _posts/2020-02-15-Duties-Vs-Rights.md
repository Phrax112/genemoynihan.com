>The conversation switched over to the new topic - the education of women.
Karenin expressed the view that the education of women was usually confused with
the question of women's emancipation and that this was the only reason for
considering it pernicious.

>"To my mind, on the contrary, these two questions are indispensably linked to each other,"
said Pestsov. "It's a vicious circle. Women are deprived of
rights because of inadequate education while the inadequacy of their
education is inadequate due to their lack of rights. It must not be forgotten that
the subjection of women is so complete and goes back so far that we often refuse
to recognize the abyss that separates them from us," he said.

>"You said 'rights'," said Koznyshov, who had been waiting for Pestsov to stop.
"The rights of jury duty, of voting on Town Councils, of presiding at local
government boards, of entering the civil service, sitting in parliament?..."

>"Unquestionably."

>"But even if women, by way of rare exception can occupy these positions then it
seems to me you were wrong in using the expression 'rights'. It would have been
more correct to say 'duties'. Anyone will agree that by performing whatever the
functions are of a juryman, a Town Councillor, or telegraph clerk we feel that
we're performing a duty. That's why it would be more correct to say that what
women are seeking is duties, and quite rightly too. One can only sympathise with
this desire of theirs to assist men in their social labours."

>"Absolutely right," agreed Karenin. "I think the only question is whether they
are suited to such duties."

>"Probably they would be very suitable," Oblonklsy put in, "as soon as education
has spread among them. We can see this-"

>"And what about the proverb?" said the old Prince, who had been listening to the
conversation for some time, his ironic little eyes twinkling: "my daughters
won't mind- 'long hair, short wits...'"

>"Just the same thing was thought about the Negroes before their emancipation!" said Pestsov angrily.

>"The only thing I find odd is that women should be seeking new duties," said Koznyshov,
"when we see men, unfortunately, as a rule avoiding them."

>"Duties are bound up with rights: power, money, honours- that's what women are seeking," said Pestov.

>"It's just the same as though I were to seek the right to be a wet nurse and felt offended at women's
being paid for it while no one wanted me," said the old Prince.

The above passage struck me when I read it as I think it suggests a missing piece in modern equality discussions, that of duties. As far as I interact with it (which is admittedly limited) the language of equality today seems to have shifted focus from "rights" to "justice", more specifically from "institutionalised suppression of rights" to "social justice" or the interaction between the individual and other social groups. This I suppose is a rather large improvement, looking around the corporate and government landscape of 2020 the only overt discrimination left in western society that we have not tried to eliminate in earnest is age based (e.g. minimum age voter laws).

However, I think this cognitive framing of "social justice" is inherently flawed. The civil rights movements of the last two centuries focused on removing suppression, lifting people up, the idea of hope and a better tomorrow for all. Whereas the idea of social justice has a far more vindictive tone focused on keeping people in line and punishing those who do not. As an outsider it also seems to suffer from a sort of quantum position/momentum problem of looking to define and punish groups which it sees as performing injustices to others while also rejecting the ability to define "groups".

I think a possible root to this problem is that with the decoupling of rights, duties and groups (i.e. in a historic society what group you belonged to defined your rights and therefore your duties to the society) we have stripped away all sense of inherent identity. Now a young person who always had a path laid before them can essentially be paralysed by choice. I'm not suggesting that identity crises are something new but I do think they are becoming more common.

I don't have any sort of concrete answer to the emerging problems in our society and how they should be fixed, frankly I wouldn't trust anyone who says they do. But, while the idea of group based rights is eroded and gone perhaps we should look at reinforcing the idea of duties to society instead, based on our aptitude and ability on an individual level. That while there are infinite possibilities for every person to pursue unabashedly there are many well trodden paths which carry no shame as a valuable duty to society.

He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.”
