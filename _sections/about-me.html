<p> I was born and raised in the west of Ireland. My academic background is in astrophysics though I now make a living by developing
  software which I have been lucky enough to do this while living and working in New York, London and Hong Kong. My main passions 
  are reading, travelling and music. I enjoy learning about just about anything and believe in being a generalist until required.
  Feel free to contact me about content on this site or any suggestions/feedback.</p>
