I'm somewhat torn on the 'known' quality vs 'diverse' quantity debate on reading which seems to be going around at the moment. I think like most things the answer lies somewhere in the murky middle, making a best effort to strike a balance between giving new and challenging books a chance while also committing time to studying known entities. In the same discussion is the balance between modern and classic literature, bestsellers and forgotten/lost gems etc... Reading is an activity which rewards you for pushing your comfort zone but at the end of the day I believe the book mostly informs you of when the time is right.

While sometimes it seems the 'yet to finish' book pile is only matched by entropy and Amazon wishlists in it's relentless march towards counting infinity these then are the books I have fully finished since earlyish 2019 when I decided to start tracking them. Doing so was an attempt to hold myself accountable to the balance discussed in the paragraph above. I will never know how successful it is in faciliating that goal, given the lack of a control in this experiment, but I think it one of those things that in a few years may provide an interesting picture. 

Or the 'yet to finish' pile will drown me, it's a race (maybe I should use a Kindle...)
